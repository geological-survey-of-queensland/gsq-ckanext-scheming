GSQ ckanext-scheming
================

This extension to the [CKAN](https://ckan.org) system provides a way to configure and share
CKAN schemas for objects within CKAN (Datasets, etc.) using a JSON schema description of them. Custom
template snippets for editing and display are also supported.

Note: Some custom view functionality like the nav bar rendering is done in the https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/gsq-ckanext-gsq-theme repository.



**This extension has been modified to cater for the schema requirements of GSQ datasets at Qld Gov.**

This instance of the scheming extension is configured for the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq)'s particular use.


Modifications
-------------

- Custom JSON schemas modelled for the project's datasets
- Enhanced form and display snippets 
  - Creator Organization select drop-down field to select an organization from the internal CKAN list
    - By default, it will automatically select the organization the user is already in (or if they're in multiple organizations, then it will select the first one by alphabetical order)
  - Linking of values to internal CKAN resources (such as Creator Organization value)
  - Select drop-down menu can fetch from online vocabulary source (in JSON format)
  - Updated the simple and generic display template for displaying custom organization schemas
  - Additional pill nav buttons for different datasets like permits, borehole, etc.
  - Enabled auto-completion for select drop-down menus
    - This is enabled for both the AJAX select and the normal select
  - Added latitude and longitude field with a CKAN validator to ensure the values follow the decimal degrees format.
  - Added fixed behaviour of viewing **Datasets** will always list datasets that are tagged as *seismic* or *geochemistry*. 
  - The Dataset page will now show *Add Seismic* and *Add Geochemistry* buttons to create new datasets in those categories. 
  - Creating a new *Seismic* or *Geochemistry* dataset will automatically add a *seismic* or *geochemistry* tag in the background (in form_snippets/large_text.html).
- Updated theme to GSQ theme.
- Added *Home* nav bar pill button.
- Added *Add Dataset* button to the `/dataset` page.
- New *Dataset* creations now attach a *dataset* tag. This is the same behaviour as *Seismic* and *Geochemistry*.
- Added new dataset schema **Report**. Nav bar pill also added.
- Removed the Groups pill nav button.
- Added Qld Gov favicon.
  
todo
----

- Review current validators for the new fields (such as creator org.) and add any other validators that are relevant.
- Show organization field information in the organization "display snippet" **only** if the value was set. Currently I've only implemented this behaviour for the Alternate organization names.
- Re-evaluate the *deprecated feature* for vocabulary values (it will always show the deprecated message because there's no system in place to fetch the vocabulary for the internal JSON schema yet) in the display snippet.
- The pill navigation buttons for datasets do not change its class to **active** as it's currently not handled by CKAN, rather it is displayed directly using HTML.
- The HTML title for each of the custom Dataset types like Boreholes, Permits, etc are rendering as **Datasets**.
- DCAT exporter only works on datasets of type **Dataset**. Currently it does not work for other custom datasets such as Boreholes, etc.

Requirements
============

This plugin is compatible with CKAN 2.3 or later.


Configuration
=============

Set the schemas you want to use with configuration options:

```ini
ckan.plugins = scheming_datasets

#   module-path:file to schemas being used
scheming.dataset_schemas = ckanext.scheming:ckan_dataset.json ckanext.scheming:permit.json ckanext.scheming:borehole.json
scheming.organization_schemas = ckanext.scheming:organization.json

#
#   URLs may also be used, e.g:
#
# scheming.dataset_schemas = http://example.com/spatialx_schema.json

#   Preset files may be included as well. The default preset setting is:
scheming.presets = ckanext.scheming:presets.json

#   The is_fallback setting may be changed as well. Defaults to false:
scheming.dataset_fallback = false
```


Example dataset schemas
-----------------------

* [default dataset schema](ckanext/scheming/ckan_dataset.json)
* [camel photos schema](ckanext/scheming/camel_photos.json)

These schemas are included in ckanext-scheming and may be enabled
with e.g: `scheming.dataset_schemas = ckanext.scheming:camel_photos.json`

These schemas use [presets](#preset) defined in
[presets.json](ckanext/scheming/presets.json).


Schema Keys
-----------


### `scheming_version`

Set to `1`. Future versions of ckanext-scheming may use a larger
number to indicate a change to the description JSON format.


### `dataset_type`

This is the "type" field stored in the dataset.
It is also used to set the URL for searching this type of dataset.

Normal datasets would be available under the URL `/dataset`, but datasets with
the `camel_photos.json` schema above would appear under `/camel-photos` instead.


### `about_url`

`about_url` is a Link to human-readable information about this schema.
Its use is optional but highly recommended.


### `dataset_fields`, `resource_fields`

Fields are specified in the order you
would like them to appear in the dataset and resource editing
pages.

Fields you exclude will not be shown to the end user, and will not
be accepted when editing or updating this type of dataset.


Field Keys
----------


### `field_name`

The `field_name` value is the name of an existing CKAN dataset or resource
field or a new new extra field. Existing dataset
field names include:

* `name` - the URI for the dataset
* `title`
* `notes` - the dataset description
* `author`
* `author_email`
* `maintainer`
* `maintainer_email`

New field names should follow the current lowercase_with_underscores
 naming convention. Don't name your field `mySpecialField`, use
 `my_special_field` instead.

This value is available to the form snippet as `field.field_name`.


### `label`

The `label` value is a human-readable label for this field as
it will appear in the dataset editing form.
This label may be a string or an object providing multiple
language versions:

```json
{
  "label": {
    "en": "Title",
    "fr": "Titre"
  },
  "...": "..."
}
```

When using a plain string translations will be provided with gettext:

```json
{
  "label": "Title",
  "...": "..."
}
```


### `required`

Set to `true` for fields that must be included. Set to `false` or
don't include this key for fields that are optional.

Setting to `true` will mark the field as required in the editing form
and include `not_empty` in the default validators that will be applied
when `validators` is not specified.

To honor this settings with custom validators include `scheming_required`
as the first validator. `scheming_required` will check the required
setting for this field and apply either the `not_empty` or `ignore_missing`
validator.


### `choices`

The `choices` list may be provided for
select and multiple choice fields.
List elements include `label`s for human-readable text for
each element (may be multiple languages like a [field label](#label))
and `value`s that will be stored in the dataset or resource:

```json
{
  "preset": "select",
  "choices": [
    {
      "value": "bactrian",
      "label": "Bactrian Camel"
    },
    "..."
  ],
  "...": "..."
}
```

### `choices_helper`

If a choices list is not provided you must provide a `choices_helper`
function that will return a list of choices in the same format as
the `choices` list above.

You may register your own helper function or use the
`scheming_datastore_choices` helper included in ckanext-scheming:

```json
{
  "preset": "select",
  "choices_helper": "scheming_datastore_choices",
  "datastore_choices_resource": "countries-resource-id-or-alias",
  "datastore_choices_columns": {
    "value": "Country Code",
    "label": "English Country Name"
  }
}
```


### `preset`

A `preset` specifies a set of default values for these field keys. They
are used to define validation and snippets for common field
types.

This extension includes the following presets:

* `"title"` - title validation and large text form snippet
* `"select"` - validation that choice is from [choices](#choices),
  form select box and display snippet
* `"multiple_checkbox"` - multiple choice from [choices](#choices)
  rendered as checkboxes in the form
* `"multiple_select"` - multiple choice from [choices](#choices)
  rendered as a multiple select box in the form
* `"date"` - date validation and form snippet
* `"datetime"` date and time validation and form snippet
* `"dataset_slug"` - dataset slug validation and form snippet that
  autofills the value from the title field
* `"tag_string_autocomplete"` - tag string validation and form autocomplete
* `"dataset_organization"` - organization validation and form select box
* `"resource_url_upload"` - resource url validaton and link/upload form
  field
* `"resource_format_autocomplete"` - resource format validation with
  format guessing based on url and autocompleting form field
* `"json_object"` - JSON based input. Only JSON objects are supported.
  The input JSON will be loaded during output (eg when loading the dataset in
  a template or via the API).


You may add your own presets by adding them to the `scheming.presets`
configuration setting.


### `form_snippet`

The `form_snippet` value is the name of the snippet template to
use for this field in the dataset or resource editing form.
A number of snippets are provided with this
extension, but you may also provide your own by creating templates
under `scheming/form_snippets/` in a template directory in your
own extension.

This snippet is passed the `field` dict containing all the keys and
values in this field record, including any additional ones
you added to your that aren't handled by this extension.

This extension includes the following form snippets:

* [text.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/text.html) -
  a simple text field for free-form text or numbers (default)
* [large_text.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/large_text.html) -
  a larger text field, typically used for the title
* [date.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/date.html) -
  a date widget with an html5 date picker
* [slug.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/slug.html) -
  the default name (URL) field
* [license.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/license.html) -
  a dataset license selection field
* [markdown.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/markdown.html) -
  a markdown field, often used for descriptions
* [organization.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/organization.html) -
  an organization selection field for datasets
* [upload.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/upload.html) -
  an upload field for resource files
* [select.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/select.html) -
  a select box
* [multiple_checkbox.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/multiple_choice.html) -
  a group of checkboxes
* [multiple_select.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/form_snippets/multiple_select.html) -
  a multiple select box


### `display_snippet`

The `display_snippet` value is the name of the snippet template to
use for this field in the dataset, resource, group or organization view page.
A number of snippets are provided with this
extension, but you may also provide your own by creating templates
under `scheming/display_snippets/` in a template directory in your
own extension.

This snippet is passed the `field` dict containing all the keys and
values in this field record, including any additional ones
you added to your that aren't handled by this extension.

This extension includes the following display snippets:

* [text.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/display_snippets/text.html) -
  render as a normal text value (default)
* [link.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/display_snippets/link.html) -
  render as an external link to open in a new window
* [email.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/display_snippets/email.html) -
  render as a "mailto:" link
* [select.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/display_snippets/select.html) -
  show the label text for the choice selected
* [multiple_choice.html](ckanext/scheming/templates/scheming/display_snippets/) -
  show the label text for all choices selected

If `null` is passed as value in `display_snippet`, it will remove the field from being displayed at the view page.

### `select_size`

Set to the number of [choices](#choices) to display in select, multiple_select
and multiple_check_box [form](#form_snippet) and [display](#display_snippet)
snippets.


### `sorted_choices`

Set to `"true"` to sort [choices](#choices) alphabetically in [form](#form_snippet)
and [display](#display_snippet) snippets.


### `validators`

The `validators` value is a space-separated string of validator and
converter functions to use for this field when creating or updating data.
When a validator name is followed by parenthesis the function is called
passing the comma-separated values within as string parameters
and the result is used as the validator/converter.

e.g. `"if_empty_same_as(name) unicode"` is the same as in a plugin specifying:

```python
[get_validator('if_empty_same_as')("name"), unicode]
```

This string does not contain arbitrary python code to be executed,
you may only use registered validator functions, optionally calling
them with static string values provided.

This extension automatically adds calls to `convert_to_extras`
for new extra fields,
so you should not add that to this list.

New validators and converters may be added using the
[IValidators plugin interface](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html?highlight=ivalidator#ckan.plugins.interfaces.IValidators).

Validators that need access to other values in this schema (e.g.
to test values against the choices list) may be decorated with
the [scheming.validation.scheming_validator](ckanext/scheming/validation.py)
function. This decorator will make scheming pass this field dict to the
validator and use its return value for validation of the field.

CKAN's [validator functions reference](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/validators.html)
lists available validators ready to be used.

### `output_validators`

The `output_validators` value is like `validators` but used when
retrieving values from the database instead of when saving them.
These validators may be used to transform the data before it is
sent to the user.

This extension automatically adds calls to `convert_from_extras`
for extra fields so you should not add that to this list.

### `create_validators`

The `create_validators` value if present overrides `validators` during
create only.

### `help_text`

Only if this key is supplied, its value will be shown as inline help text,
Help text must be plain text, no markdown or HTML are allowed.
Help text may be provided in multiple languages like [label fields](#label).

### `help_inline`

Display help text inline if set to `true`. Default is `false`.
